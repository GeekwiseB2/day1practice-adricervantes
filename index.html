          <li>I honestly do not know how I feel about this second course.</li>
          <li>I have alot of patience, but in this class, I have none.</li>
          <li>I wish it was a lot like the first course with damon. </li>
          <li>It was always exciting to be able to walk into that class and hear music, it was so inviting.</li>
          <li>BONUS: You may style however you'd like</li>
